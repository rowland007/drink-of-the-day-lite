I started this project back in 2009 or 2010. The idea came from a friend. He used to say everyday had a theme for a type drink. We ended up hanging up a repeating seven day calendar that just showed these themes. This is my very first Android application I made.

* Sometimes Sunday
* Margarita Monday
* Tequila Tuesday
* Whiskey Wednesday
* Thirsty Thursday
* F*cked Up Friday
* Sh!tfaced Saturday

I decided I would turn it into an app that would give you ingredients and directions on how to make a drink based on the theme of the day.

It was originally designed for Android 4.0 "Ice Cream Sandwich".

On loading of the application, a SQL database is created and populated with the drinks. Then at random it pulls and displays the drinks information from the database. If you  do not like that drink, you can press the button at the bottom to get another random drink.
